# YouTube Music native client specification

Build a native desktop music client that closely matches YouTube Music and uses fewer resources than the current web wrapper. Ship Arch Linux/KDE first with shared Python/PySide6 and Qt Quick/QML code for later Windows and macOS releases.

Project: [YouTube Music Native Client](https://linear.app/nouvelle-lune-atelier/project/youtube-music-native-client-1fd71f68c65b).

## Required experience

Use the current signed-in desktop app as the visual reference: dark background, typography hierarchy, top search, left navigation and playlist shortcuts, artwork shelves, context menus and fixed bottom player. Reference geometry is 1280 by 820 pixels with a 240 pixel sidebar and approximately 72 pixel player. Preserve a 920 by 620 minimum, responsive content, visible keyboard focus and accessible controls.

Required views are Home, Explore, search, library, playlist, album, artist, expanded player, queue, lyrics and Downloads. Capture each reference before implementing its layout. Exclude deferred features from the native controls rather than displaying inactive promises.

Required account behavior for the user's single Premium account:

- Personalized Home shelves, Explore charts/moods/genres, music search/suggestions/filters and artist/album pages.
- Library contents, saved music, subscriptions, playlist shortcuts and ratings.
- Playlist create/rename/delete, add/remove/reorder and correct handling of duplicate entries.
- Native audio-only playback, seek, previous/next, volume/mute, shuffle, repeat, radio/autoplay, online history and an editable queue.
- Expanded player and available lyrics, with timing when returned by the provider.
- Persist window/sidebar preferences, volume, queue and position; restore playback paused after restart.
- Media keys, familiar keyboard shortcuts and KDE media controls; shortcuts must respect text-entry focus.

Videos, podcasts, casting, uploads, free-account behavior, automatic playlist download synchronization and crossfade are outside the first release.

## Downloads and offline behavior

A single song, album or playlist can be downloaded with its metadata, artwork and collection order. Playlist downloads are manual snapshots; repeating Download refreshes the snapshot.

Every playback entry point checks for a completed local asset before resolving a remote source. Downloaded audio always plays from disk, even while online, without stream resolution or audio-network requests for that track. An offline restart must not require authentication refresh. Downloads are retained across app restarts and upgrades until explicitly removed.

Provide progress, cancellation, retry, offline browsing, removal and storage usage. Persist jobs and preserve completed tracks after failure. Resume partial media when supported; otherwise restart only that track. Validate and atomically finalize each asset before marking it ready. Share audio files between collections and retain them while any downloaded collection or individually saved song references them.

Handle disk-full, missing and corrupt files clearly without losing other completed downloads. Damaged files receive a repair indication and can fall back to streaming when online. Offline queues skip unavailable items with a visible explanation. Local playback/queue operations remain available; account mutations require connectivity. Cache lyrics when already available without making them a download prerequisite.

## Architecture and portability

- Native rendering: Qt 6, Qt Quick/QML, PySide6. Use virtualized list views, asynchronous artwork and bounded caches; keep network, SQLite work and extraction off the GUI thread.
- Catalog: ytmusicapi with small normalized MediaItem, Collection and paginated-result models. Preserve provider mutation identifiers and continuation tokens inside the catalog module. QML does not consume raw provider responses.
- Authentication: guided local browser-session import and secure OS keyring storage. The user has explicitly authorized reusing the existing Tauri session for migration/proof. Keep credentials out of source, fixtures, process arguments, logs and tickets. Expiry produces a reconnect banner without blocking local audio.
- Source resolution/downloads: yt-dlp managed workers, yt-dlp-ejs, Deno and FFmpeg/ffprobe. Preserve the best available authenticated audio-only format without routine transcoding. Cache remote sources only until expiry and retry expired resolution once.
- Playback: libmpv through python-mpv. The app owns LocalFile/RemoteStream selection, queue state and upcoming-track preparation. Do not load the YouTube website for playback.
- Persistence: SQLite metadata and durable downloads in Qt's standard app-data directory, separate from replaceable artwork caches. Store secrets only through secure keyring backends.
- Keep catalog, playback/source selection and downloads behind small interfaces with fixture/fake adapters for tests. There is no hosted backend or public HTTP interface.
- Use Qt standard paths/settings. Keep OS media controls, secure-storage integration and packaging out of shared application logic.
- Run early Linux/Windows/macOS launch and local-audio smoke checks. Later ports reuse the UI, catalog, storage and playback code and validate platform-specific dependencies on real machines.

The native application lives under native/ while the current Tauri wrapper remains available. The first Linux release uses a separate youtube-music-native package, separate application data and native-v* tags.

## Compatibility gate

Before substantial UI implementation, prove authenticated catalog access, audio-only streaming, downloading, and replay in a new process with networking disabled using the user's real imported session. Save a redacted compatibility report. Fixture tests alone cannot pass this gate. Required unsupported features or unavailable playback formats are explicit blockers.

Initial access testing must be read-only against the account. Playlist mutation tests later use clearly named reversible test content.

## Verification and performance

Use sanitized provider fixtures, synthetic visual content and generated/local licensed audio in committed tests. Keep private account screenshots and session files outside the repository.

Test pagination, stale search responses, provider errors, duplicate playlist entries, queue transitions, shuffle/repeat, expired sessions/sources, download interruption/restart, corrupt media, disk-full, shared-file removal, mixed offline queues, suspend/resume and update preservation.

Assert across all playback entry points that downloaded audio starts without stream resolution or fetching its audio. Repeat after an offline restart and with expired credentials.

The planning sample measured approximately 537 MiB proportional-set memory across four current-wrapper processes during a 10 second visible-playback interval on Arch/KDE Wayland. This is preliminary evidence, not a controlled benchmark; the running wrapper may differ from main.

Establish matched wrapper/native baselines on the same machine, content, account, window and network. Count all app workers. Measure repeated cold/warm launches, track starts/skips, a scrolling scenario, minimized playback and a 30 minute mixed-use soak.

| Area | Release target |
| --- | --- |
| Scrolling | Approximately 60 fps; p95 frame time at most 16.7 ms |
| Local controls | Visible response within 100 ms |
| Interactive shell | At most 2 seconds cold and 1 second warm |
| Downloaded audio start | At most 250 ms |
| Steady playback memory | At most 300 MiB PSS and at least 40 percent below matched wrapper baseline |
| Minimized CPU | Average at most 2 percent of one logical core |
| Streaming startup and skips | No worse than matched wrapper baseline |

Fix missed targets before the Linux release and attach actual results. Visual checks cover 1280 by 820 and 920 by 620 layouts, focus, loading, empty and retry states.

## Reference inventory

| Reference | Evidence and follow-up |
| --- | --- |
| Home/sidebar/search/shelves/bottom player | Running app inspected during planning; private capture is outside the repository |
| Explore/search/library | Capture before implementing these views |
| Playlist/album/artist | Capture layouts and mutation interactions before implementation |
| Expanded player/queue/lyrics | Capture layouts, keyboard actions and empty states |
| Downloads | New view following the existing visual language |
| Performance | Preliminary memory sample only; controlled baseline belongs to the verification work |

The Linear issues contain milestones, blocking relations, acceptance criteria and verification requirements. M0 is Todo/In Progress; subsequent work starts in Backlog. Windows and macOS are later delivery milestones, while portability checks start during the native foundation.

## Git and release workflow

Fetch the latest origin/main and create each ticket branch directly from it. The branch name is exactly the assigned identifier, for example LUNE-335. Do not use agent/* branches as bases, create descriptive branch suffixes or stack work on unmerged ticket branches.

Commit subjects follow LUNE-335 - Change-specific message, using the current ticket's identifier. Every PR targets main. Merge through the PR only after its work is complete, review concerns are resolved and all required checks pass for the current head. Do not push implementation changes directly to main.

The current Tauri application remains available during native development and the initial separate-package release. Google interface changes remain an ongoing maintenance dependency.
